<h2>Brief History of CSS</h2> 
<p>CSS grew out of the necessity of styling web pages. Before CSS was introduced, people wanted a way to style their webpages whihc looked all very similar and "academic" back in the day. Not much was possible in terms of personalization. <br> CSS lets us move enerything presentation-related from the HTML to the CSS so HTML could get back to being the format that defines the structure of the document, rather than how things should look in the browser. <br> CSS is continuoulsy evolving, and CSS you used 5 years ago might just be oudated,as new CSS techniques emerged and browsers changed. It's hard to imagine the times when CSS was born and how different the web was, AT the time, there were several competing browsers, mainly internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. <br> Pages were styled by using HTML, with special presentational tags like bold and special attributes, most of which are now deprecated. This menant you had a limited amount of customization opportunites. The bulk of the styling decisions were left to the browser. Also you built a site for one of them, because each one ontroduced different non-standard tags to give more power and opportunities. <br><br> Soon peopele realized the need for a way to style pages, in a way that would work across all brosers. After the initial idea was proposed in 1994, CSS got its first release in 1996, when the CSS level 1 recommendation was published, and CSS level 2 got published in 1998, Since then, work began on CSS level 3 . The CSS working Group decided t split every feature and work on it separately. The first CSS level 3 module was released in the year 1999.  </p>
<h2>CSS version</h2> Cascading Styly Sheets is a fairly old technology as far as the Wen is concerned. CSS has evolved over time through different versions, with each version introducing new features, improvements, and capabilites for web desingers and develoers. <br><br>
Here is a brief overview of some of the major versions of CSS <br><br>
<h3>CSS 1</h3> 
Classic CSS implementation that introduced the text, list, margin, border, color, and background properties. Initially defined in 1996, almost every feature of CSS 1 is supproted in Web browsers, but small quirks do exist around some lesser-used features like white spece letter-spacing, dispaly, and others. Some probles with CSS1 support are more significant in older, pre-internt Explorer 7 browsers.
<h3>CSS 2</h3>  The specification is primarily known for positioning and media, particularly print-style sheet features. Many aspects of CSS2, such as aural style sheets, were never widely implemented and were removed in a later iteration of the CSS specification. <br>
<h3>CSS 2.1</h3>  This was a revision of CSS2 and was released in 2004. It clarified and improved the CSS2 specification,fixing inconsistencies and adding new features,but it did not introduce any major changes.
<h3>CSS3</h3> This version of CSS is not a single relase but rather a collection of modules that are developed and released independently. CSS3 introduces a wide range of new features and capabilities, including advanced selectors,gradients,shadows, animations, trasitions, and more. Some of the modules in CSS3 include selectors, Box Model,Backgrounds and Borders,Text Effects, and Transorm.
<h3>Anatomy Structure of CSS</h3> The anatomy of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) refers to the different components or parts that make up CSS and how they work together to style web pages.
